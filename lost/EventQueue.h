/** double buffered, thread safe event queue.
 * Borrow events from a EventPool.
 * Store them here for later processing.
 *
 * Event consuming code and event generating code will always run in seperate threads.
 * Events will returned to the pool in bulk once the current frame has been completely processed.
 * During the processing of the current queue, the "next" queue will be filled by the other thread
 * with new incoming events. 
 * 
 * This prevents events from being dropped. Using only a single queue can lead to scenarios where events
 * are added to a queue AFTER the engine processing and BEFORE the current frame ends and events are cleaned
 * up, leading to events simply being dropped and changes not being communicated to the engine.
